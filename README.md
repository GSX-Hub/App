## Support the App
- The App's infrastructure costs roughly £15 GBP every month to upkeep. If you like it and would love to help support, please follow the links to support.
- Any donation, great or small will be solely used towards the upkeep of infrastructure.
- If you'd like to go above and beyond that, I would be grateful if you dropped by one of my rare [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hinshee) streams and said hi! The app is made for the community, so it would make may day to hear from you.
